# Restaurant-menu-analysis
### Problem to be solved 
- To analyse a dataset of a restaurant's menu items and identify which items are most popular among customers. Additionally,use this analysis to optimise the restaurant's revenue by recommending changes to the menu


### Dataset-description
● item_id: A unique ID for each menu item

● item_name: The name of the menu item

● item_description: A brief description of the menu item

● item_type: The type of menu item (appetiser, entree, dessert, etc.)

● item_price: The price of the menu item

● rating: The average customer rating of the menu item (on a scale of 1 to 5)

● sales_count: The number of times the menu item has been sold in the past quarter

● cost_per_item: The cost of producing each menu item

### Insights

- There is no any recognized relationship between rating and item price.

- The best average rated item_type category is drink

- Total revenue generated by the restaurant in the past quarter is $621,253.76.

- Maximum gross profit margin is $99.791025 for the item - shrimp bread pork entree.


### Summary:
- Menu items with lowest gross profit margins are - shrimp pork tofu beef appetizer, pork rice chicken tofu drink, rice tofu appetizer, beef vegetables shrimp bread entree, vegetables beef shrimp noodles entree
- The average cost of items which is vegeterian is having higher cost compared to items which is non-veg
- Having beef as an ingredients in the items results in the increase of average of cost per item, which means we need to cut some quality of beef in the ingredients and we can try to get a suppilier which can provide beef as less price
- Based on sales count and gross profit margin, some of the items from the menu can be removed and some can be promoted.


### Plan to optimizing the menu to maximize revenue
- Remove the items from the menu having low sales count and low gross profit margin.
- Promote the items having a high sales count and increase the item price to get more gross profit margin.
- Decrese the item price for the items having good rating but low sales count.
- Either remove the items or increase the price of items from menu having items with low gross profit margin and having high cost ingredients
- Since veg items have high pricing, remove the veg-items having low popularity
